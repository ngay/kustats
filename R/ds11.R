#' Data Set 11: Ages of Oscar Winners
#' 
#' Ages (years) of actresses and actors at the times that they won Oscars for the
#' categories of Best Actress and Best Actor.  The ages are listed in chronological
#' order by row, so that corresponding locations in the two tables are from the
#' same year.  (Notes: In 1968 there was a tie in the Best Actress category, and
#' the mean of the two ages is used; in 1932 there was a tie in the best Actor
#' category, and the mean of the two ages is used.  These data are suggested by
#' the article "Ages of Oscar-winning Best Actors and Actresses" by Richard Brown
#' and Gretchen Davis, \strong{Mathematics Teacher} magazine.  In that article, 
#' the year of birth of the award winner was subtracted from the year the awards
#' ceremony, but the ages listed here are calculated from teh birth date of the
#' winner and the date of the awards ceremony.) The data are complete as of this 
#' writing.
